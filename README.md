# Overdrive for Kodi
This addon lets you listen to audiobooks from [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) (aka [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/)) in Kodi. You can add all your libraries and this addon will list your borrowed books from all of them.

## Instructions
Grab the zip file from the releases page. 
Install with Kodi in Addons -> "Install from zip file".
Open the addon and go to "Add/Remove Libraries" -> "Add Library".
Fill in your details.
Example URL:

    https://deichman.overdrive.com/
or simply

    deichman
The latter is equivalent to the former.
Username is usually your library card number.
Leave Password blank if  not required by your library.

Your audiobooks should now be listed when you reopen the addon.


## TODOs (that I probably won't do any time soon)
Write tests.
Add support for resuming.
Test more libraries. (Only tested with the 3 available to me, Stavanger, Deichman and Viken)


## Special thanks to
Overdrive for their service.
The Norwegian libraries that are a part of Overdrive.

## Legal
This addon is not authorized by Overdrive. It does not circumvent any restrictions in Overdrive's services, but instead works in the same way as Overdrive's own software. This means that you will still need a valid library card and also a license for each book you listen to (you need to have "borrowed" them).
